## About The Project

[Expedition](https://expedition.dev) is a minimal block explorer for Ethereum Stack and utilizes [Jade Service Runner](https://github.com/etclabscore/jade-service-runner) for managing background services (Multi-Geth), OpenRPC for underlying functionality, and Pristine. It does not use a database, and can be configured to point at any remote RPC node for any EVM-based network. The goal of Jade Explorer is to provide a resource for network information and block exploration.

Explorer Features:
- Display chain id
- Syncing status
- Runtime configuration for endpoints
- Search by Block, Transaction, Address
- Charts for hash, transaction count, gas used, uncles
- Preview latest blocks with pagination
- Multi-language support

<!-- getting started with the project -->
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- node `v10.15.3` or later
- npm `v6.4.1` or later

### Installation
Clone/ download the project, and install dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/etclabscore/expedition.git && cd expedition && npm install
```

<!-- example usage, screen shots, demos -->
## Usage
### Run service
If you don't have a [service-runner](https://github.com/etclabscore/jade-service-runner) running, then you can use the one in the package.json via: (or see the configuration section below to provide your own ethereum rpc URL):
```bash
npm run service-runner
```
*Jade Service Runner will run at http://localhost:8002/.*

#### Core-Geth & Service Runner

By default, core-geth service will run ETC mainnet. Jade Service runner conveniently contains the service in the `/.services/` directory of project.

```bash
# ./services/
.
└── core-geth
    └── 1.11.2
        └── core-geth
            └── 1.11.2
                └── classic
                    ├── geth
                    │   ├── chaindata
                    │   ├── ethash
                    │   └── nodes
                    └── keystore
```

### Start the explorer
```bash
npm start
```
*The explorer will run at http://localhost:3000/.*

### Configurations Awl

#### Set rpc via url

`?rpcUrl=` Set custom rpc url.

Example: https://expedition.dev/?rpcUrl=https://swissdlt-dev.appswithlove.net/rpc/

#### Configure default urls via environment variables

Override eth url

*Windows (cmd.exe)*
```
set "REACT_APP_ETH_RPC_URL=https://swissdlt-dev.appswithlove.net/rpc/" && npm start
```

*Windows (Powershell)*
```
($env:REACT_APP_ETH_RPC_URL = "https://swissdlt-dev.appswithlove.net/rpc/") -and (npm start)
```

*Linux, macOS (Bash)*
```
REACT_APP_ETH_RPC_URL=https://swissdlt-dev.appswithlove.net/rpc/ npm start
```

**OR**

Override service runner url

*Windows (cmd.exe)*
```
set "REACT_APP_SERVICE_RUNNER_URL=https://swissdlt-dev.appswithlove.net/rpc/" && npm start
```

*Windows (Powershell)*
```
($env:REACT_APP_SERVICE_RUNNER_URL = "https://swissdlt-dev.appswithlove.net/rpc/") -and (npm start)
```

*Linux, macOS (Bash)*
```
REACT_APP_SERVICE_RUNNER_URL=https://services.jade.builders/ npm start
```
